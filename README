Node.js based Blackjack server.

Run create_tables.js to create the needed tables for the server.
    
You will also need a Self-Signed Certificate to run the server.
Here are a set of instructions on how to do this:
(On Windows there will need to be an openssl executable in the folder,
 as will the supplied openssl.conf file)
   openssl genrsa -des3 -out server.key 1024
   openssl req -config openssl.conf -new -key server.key -out server.csr
   copy server.key server.key.org
   openssl rsa -in server.key.org -out server.key
   openssl x509 -req -days 9999 -in server.csr -signkey server.key -out server.crt

Then copy server.crt and server.key to sslcert/
